	"desc": "This is very much not intended for use, but merely as a tool to (hopefully) help understand how to write an X11 compositing window manager better than what the quite frankly pisspoor documentation provides. As such, many best practices are not employed, and a lot of features you'd want to implement aren't implemented (list near the end of this document). It's also worth noting that I'm in no way shape or form an expert on X, this was just a weekend project that works by miracle.\n\nThis was also originally meant as a prototype to AQUA's `wm.*` devices, so some coding decisions and comments may seem a bit strange.\n\nI may or may not end up updating this with new features, but I welcome any pull requests you might have!\n\nWWW: https://github.com/obiwac/x-compositing-wm",
